# HOW TO RUN my-vue-project

1. Install Node.js and npm

Vue.js projects rely on Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies. Here’s how you can install it:

Download and Install Node.js:

Go to the Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/en).
Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version, which includes both Node.js and npm.
Follow the instructions to install it on your system.
Verify Installation: After installation, open the terminal (or command prompt) and check if Node.js and npm were installed correctly by running:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
This will display the versions of Node.js and npm if they're installed correctly.

2. Clone the Repository
You need to clone the repository to your local machine. Here’s how:

Open the terminal and run:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/samadhichandrasena/github-hackathon.git

Navigate into the project folder(github hackathon):

bash
Copy code
cd my-vue-project

3. Install Project Dependencies
In the project folder, you need to install all the dependencies (like Vue.js, Vuetify, etc.) listed in the package.json file.

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will download all the necessary packages.

4. Run the Project
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the Vue development server to run the project locally:

Run this command:

bash
Copy code
npm run serve
This will start the development server, and you should see output like this:

bash
Copy code
App running at:
- Local:   http://localhost:8080/
- Network: http://192.168.x.x:8080/
You can now open their browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to view the app.
